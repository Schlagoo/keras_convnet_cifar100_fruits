# Project: Keras Convnet CIFAR-100 fruits

This repository contains a deep convolutional neural network to classify CIFAR-100 fruits-data. The network was created with the tensorflow high-level API *keras* in python 3.6.7.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to run the script on your maschine. First of all you need `python3` installed, as well as following packages:

~~~
Keras==2.2.4
numpy==1.15.1
scikit_learn==0.20.2
~~~

Install them via `pip3 install -d requirements.txt`.

### Installing

Before running the script clone the repository to your desired directory:

~~~
cd /path/to/desired/directory
git clone git@github.com:Schlagoo/keras_convnet_cifar100_fruits.git
~~~

You should now be able to run the script from the terminal (linux) via:

(Make shure you the file is executable: `sudo chmod +x keras_convnet_cifar100.py`!)

~~~
./keras_convnet_cifar100.py
~~~
